Comments in test file do not affect the parser on purpose. Since normally compilers do not see comments. (if we want to: we return COMMENT token and when program see a COMMENT token prints a comment)
Other statements are printed out to ease the evaulation.
At the end program return if it works correctly or not. 
If valid it returns how many lines there are. 
If not where the error is.
